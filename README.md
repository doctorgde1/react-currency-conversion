# react-currency-conversion

Test task in react. Currency conversion app.

## User stories:

1. As a user, I can

   - choose the currency to convert from
   - choose the currency to convert to
   - input some amount of currency in both the currency to which it is being converted and the one being converted and see the corresponding value of the other currency on the other side.

2. As a Ukrainian, I want to have the current exchange rate of the US dollar and the euro against the hryvnia in quick access, so that i don't need to use converter every time.
